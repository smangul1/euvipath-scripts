# euvipath-scripts


Here we provide scripts and commands we used in our study "" to run existing microbiome profiling tools on both simulated and real data. Preprint of the study is available at 

# Compare to existing tools

We have compared euViPath to the following microbiome profiling tools:
* Metahplan2, which version
* SURPI
* Kraken
